# Sorting-Algorithms
Implementation of four key sorting algorithms in C/C++. The four sorting algorithms are Insertion sort, Selection sort, Shell sort and Quick Sort.

Quick sort implementation is available as part of a comparison between Insertion sort and Quick sort in the file named "SortComparisonView.cpp". A more flexible version of Insertion sort is also available as part of the comparison in the above mentioned file. 

Quick and Insertion sort Comparison is a VC++ GUI interface based program which provides a runtime comparison of the two sorting algorithms with graphs. The amount of time it takes to sort the data is stored for comparison.
